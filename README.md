Blog-Roman-Kozar-v.3.0.1
========================

I tyr to develop my blog. And it's my second variant of the blog.

Once I thought about it and decided that dimmed blog something is not necessary. 
I decided to write something new, minimalistic and simple. 

Here is my version of a simple and convenient blog. 
I tried to take into account all the points about cross-browser. 
I tried for the first time to write an adaptive layout. 

But I do not know how it happened :).
